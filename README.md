# **<ins>ML Volcano Eruption Project</ins>** :volcano:

This project was made by two friends who had a question in mind:
Can we predict Volcano Eruptions using ML models? or atleast predict their scale of the eruption using those models?<br />

# <ins>Data Cleaning</ins>  
Cleaning and improving our data:
Format normalization,
nulls handling,
String handling.<br />


# <ins>Visulization</ins> 
Explaining our data:<br />
Graphs. :bar_chart:<br /> 
Showing relations and relatives.<br />
What feature vectors acquired from our data aqcuisition.<br />
