# **<ins>ML Volcano Eruption Project</ins>**

This project was made by two dear friends who had a question in mind:
Can we predict Volcano Eruptions using ML models? or atleast predict their scale of the eruption using those models?<br />

Cleaning and improving our data:
Format normalization,
nulls handling,
String handling.<br />


# <ins>Visulization</ins> 
Explaining our data:<br />
Graphs.<br />
Showing relations and relatives.<br />
What feature vectors acquired from our data aqcuisition.<br />

# Machine Learning:
Predicting the volume of eruption:<br />
